## About Me
I'm currently a student majoring in Computer Science at Humboldt State University. I originally went to school for music, but along the way found that I had an aptitude for and a desire to work in the Computer Science field. After 15 years of working for multiple companies in both systems administration and software engineering roles I decided to go back to school to finish my post secondary education. I'm planning on completing my BS is Computer Science and Humboldt State University. After this I plan on finding an acceptable graduate school to continue to pursue a post graduate degree.
