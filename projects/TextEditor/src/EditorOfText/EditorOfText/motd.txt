	This editor is going to need to be able to wrap lines that are too long to display. Thats why this line is so long that it goes off the side of the screen. It makes testing easier. This should be wrapping around the screen and not be going off the side of the screen.

	This editor
	is also going
	to need to
	be able to
	scroll down
	when text
	goes off the
	end of the
	screen. We
	Need some way
	to take care
	of scrolling
	when text
	goes too far
	down. That's
	why I'm 
	typing this
	section like
	this. It will
	help with testing.
	You should be
	able to scroll
	down and see
	this text.
